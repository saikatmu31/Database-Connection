Connection to MongoDB using Node.js and Mongoose
This is a simple example of how to connect to MongoDB using Node.js and Mongoose.

Prerequisites
Node.js installed
MongoDB installed and running
Installation
To get started, clone the repository and navigate to the directory in your terminal. Then, install the dependencies using the following command:

Copy code
npm install
Usage
To run the application, use the following command:

Copy code
node index.js
This will start the application and connect to the MongoDB database using the dbConnect() function.

The mongoose.connect() method is used to connect to the MongoDB database. The first argument is the connection string, which specifies the host and port of the database. The second argument is an options object, which includes the useNewUrlParser and useUnifiedTopology options.

The dbConnect() function is called when the application starts, and it attempts to connect to the database. If the connection is successful, it logs a message to the console. If the connection fails, it logs an error message to the console.

The app.listen() method is used to start the Express server and listen for incoming requests. The app.get() method is used to define a route that returns a message when the application is running.

Configuration
To connect to a different MongoDB database, update the connection string in the mongoose.connect() method.

For more information on how to use Mongoose, refer to the Mongoose documentation.
